      <h2> About Page: </h2>
      <div id="wholeBox">
        <p style="font-weight: bold"> What it does: </p>
        <p> The application we plan to build will take in and display people's’
          thoughts on an anonymous platform. I propose the name “Just putting
          it out there” for this application. We plan to store all of the
          entry’s on a database and have options for random or most recent
          entry’s displayed on the front page of the application.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="wholeBox">
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Possible Pitfall: </p>
        <p>People have a tendency to get really rude and mean when they are
          given anonymity. Without compromising the anonymity of our users
          it would be difficult problem to control. Perhaps a solution
          could be adding a “flag post” option, which would temporarily
          pull that post until it can be approved or pulled permanently.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="wholeBox">
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Who it serves: </p>
        <p>The person who is too scared to tell the person they have a crush
          one that they care for them. The person who has a grievance that
          they can not express in the workplace. The person who has a random
          thought, they would like to share.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="wholeBox">
        <p style="font-weight: bold">In the context of Existing Applications: </p>
        <p>This has the functionality much like a Facebook wall or twitter
          feed, except all in one place, a community shared feed. While
          these existing applications have relative anonymity, our application
          will offer total anonymity.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="wholeBox">
        <p style="font-weight: bold">The reason for application: </p>
        <p>Someone may be too nervous to actually say how they feel out loud
          this gives them a convenient place to “put it out there” perhaps
          in time that person might gain the courage to say something to
          their crush! Sometimes your boss is mean and rude and you need
          a place to vent, you face a very real of risk being fired if
          you post that on any other platform currently available.</p>
