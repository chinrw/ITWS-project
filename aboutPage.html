    <h2> About Page: </h2>
    <p style="font-weight: bold"> What it does: </p>
    <p> The application we plan to build will take in and display people's’ thoughts on an anonymous platform. I propose the name “Just putting it out there” for this application. We plan to store all of the entry’s on a database and have options for random or most recent entry’s displayed on the front page of the application.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Possible Pitfall: </p>
    <p>People have a tendency to get really rude and mean when they are given anonymity. Without compromising the anonymity of our users it would be difficult problem to control. Perhaps a solution could be adding a “flag post” option, which would temporarily pull that post until it can be approved or pulled permanently.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">Who it serves: </p>
    <p>The person who is too scared to tell the person they have a crush one that they care for them. The person who has a grievance that they can not express in the workplace. The person who has a random thought, they would like to share.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">In the context of Existing Applications: </p>
    <p>This has the functionality much like a Facebook wall or twitter feed, except all in one place, a community shared feed. While these existing applications have relative anonymity, our application will offer total anonymity.</p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold">The reason for application: </p>
    <p>Someone may be too nervous to actually say how they feel out loud this gives them a convenient place to “put it out there” perhaps in time that person might gain the courage to say something to their crush! Sometimes your boss is mean and rude and you need a place to vent, you face a very real of risk being fired if you post that on any other platform currently available.</p>
